# Broadcast Transaction Instructions

WRW now supports natively broadcasting transactions from the UI itself. User needs to select the coin and copy the fully signed serialized transaction. For users that use OVC (Offline Vault Console), this is the 'txHex' field from the fully signed JSON file.

### This feature is currently supported for the following coins -
- HBAR
- ALGO (Note: BitGo doesn't have an external node for Algo and requires clients to input the details of their node)
